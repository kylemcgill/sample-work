# sample-work

The purpose of this repository is to showcase my development skills in python. All work shown here is my own with only common libraries (scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, scipy, etc.) used.  If you are a lurker, feel free to poke around; although, I'm sure nothing done here is ground breaking.


**Future Work**

This repository is expected to grow over time as I attempt new public challenges. The hope is to attempt a variety of different datasets to develop my skills.
